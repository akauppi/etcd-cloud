# Backup

Our aims:

- automated, scheduled backups
- manual restores, with clear instructions
- target: Google Cloud Storage

No automated restores because every restore involves likely loss of data.

## Alternative 1: etcd-backup-operator


This seems to come with `etcd-operator`, and is likely interconnected with it. It's provided under the "examples" folder, which (to me) implies that it's not really ready, but something... in the works.

Also:

>Note that currently the `etcd-restore-operator` only supports restoring from backups saved on S3.

This is game over for me, since I wish to use Google baskets for the backups. 


## Alternative 2: ???

>To recover from disastrous failure, etcd v3 provides snapshot and restore facilities to recreate the cluster without v3 key data loss. 

What does that mean?  What should the operators do?



I did not find information on how to do a manual backup of etcd v3 cluster's data. 

See [Is there an "admin" page for etcd v3](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/etcd-dev/CM6rfOlL3fU) (Google Groups) for background.
