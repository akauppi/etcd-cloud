# Certificates

In etcd v3, certificates can be used for identification of the etcd peers, the server towards clients, or the clients (with integration for authentication).

If the etcd cluster is run locally, in the same cluster (and namespace) with the service using it, none of this is really needed, and we can work on the users, roles, and passwords alone.
